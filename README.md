Website 1 - Shoe Company 

This Website is for a Shoe company, I developd two HTML pages and also used CSS to design the page. 
h1 : <h1> defines the most important heading.

h2 : <h2> defines the second most important heading.

div : The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS.

a : The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

img : The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

br : The <br> tag inserts a single line break. This tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.this tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.

table : HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

tr : Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.tr stands for table row.

th : The <th> tag defines a header cell in an HTML table. The text in <th> elements are bold and centered by default.

td : Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag. td stands for table data. Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.

form : The <form> tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.

label : The <label> HTML element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

input : The <input> HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are 
available, depending on the device

footer : The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.
